This is probably the hardest character I've every had the displeasure of ripping, even surpassing Amara, thanks to the plethora of technical issues and errors throughout Geiru. I would not have made this character without the addition of the overlays, saving tons of filespace and time consumed rendering this character over and over again to make sure there aren't any errors. I don't think there's a harder character in AA to rip as of July 27th 2022, good luck finding one.
