How to Save and Load Cases
---------------

/save_case
Use this once you've put the evidence in client - this will save it to this folder with a specificed name.

/load_case
Load the case using its name.
Make sure to set evidence pos to all, or set it to def/pro if you only want a specific side to be able to see it. Once evidence is presented, it will become public.
